# Cruising Wheels Site
Combining my love for motorcycles and coding, I built a simple responsive website for a motorcycle agency.

## Objective
The objective of this site was to practice HTML5, CSS3 and the Intersection Observer API in order to create a navigation bar that changed style when a user scrolls, as well as a dropdown menu for when users are viewing the page on their mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- Responsive CSS3
- Javascript ES6
- Intersection Observer API
